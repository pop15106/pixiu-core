# Codex Connection & Audit Protocol

> **Role**: Codex is the Chief Audit Officer of the Pixiu Fleet.

## Vault Init — Low Token Session Protocol

Before auditing or generating code:

1. Resolve PixiuCore path in order: `PIXIU_CORE`, `PIXIU_CORE_PATH`, `%USERPROFILE%\.pixiu-core`.
2. Read `%PIXIU_CORE%\vault\README.md` to confirm the mothership boundary and init sequence.
3. Read `%PIXIU_CORE%\user_rules.md`; keep L0 hard gates resident.
4. Read `%PIXIU_CORE%\vault\context\ai-mothership-loading-policy.md`.
5. Read concise identity and memory summaries:
   - `%PIXIU_CORE%\vault\identity\founder-profile.md`
   - `%PIXIU_CORE%\vault\identity\agent-persona.md`
   - `%PIXIU_CORE%\vault\memory\memory-summary.md`
6. Do not load recap or decision full text unless the task triggers it.

## Lazy Loading Rules

- L1-L6 stay as routing summaries until the task triggers deeper rules.
- Skills, workflows, hooks, agents, recaps, and decision files load on semantic intent, not only exact keywords.
- Second brain results are leads only; verify with vault source or repo source before conclusions.
- Agent team is not default. Judge, explain, and wait for explicit user approval before dispatch.
- Codex subagents receive compact task packets only and must not reload the full mothership.

## Audit Objectives

1. **Correctness**: Logic meets business needs, no boundary vulnerabilities.
2. **Readability**: Intuitive naming, no stale comments or debug code.
3. **Consistency**: Follows `%PIXIU_CORE%\user_rules.md` and the loading policy.
4. **Simplification**: No unnecessary duplication, no broad refactor without approval.
5. **Portability**: Mothership rules must work across devices and locations through environment-variable path resolution.

## Trigger

When an AI completes implementation and starts final self-correction.

## Connection Status

- **Mothership Link**: Active through resolved PixiuCore path.
- **Review Standard**: Pixiu 7-Layer Architecture with low-token lazy loading.
- **Version**: v1.1.0
